                                            </p>
                                            <p>The first week of camp was described to me as "drinking from a fire
                                                hose". I would have to 100% agree with that.
                                                We are taking in a ton of information right now. This was expected.
                                                What I did not expect was the type of
                                                content we are absorbing. I expected to be cramming information
                                                about actual code in itself. As of now we are
                                                learning more about the programs and collaborative processes that we
                                                will be using for the rest of camp. I
                                                believe this approach will give us each a strong foundational
                                                knowledge before we move forward with our coding
                                                journeys.</p>

                                            <p>Right now the biggest struggle for me is wrapping my brain around how
                                                all of our coding software (git, GitHub, VS
                                                code, MAMP etc.) work in unison. During the FIYO stage of my
                                                application process we used a simple coding website
                                                like code pen. This was a very easy coding tool to use and it was
                                                all right there in front of you in one place.
                                                After starting to familiarize myself with all of our new software, I
                                                can see how and why using the different
                                                software will be beneficial. </p>

                                            <p>Our lead instructor, Justin, encourages us to share our "ah ha!"
                                                moments. I have found in my journey so far that
                                                these are the best parts of coding- that moment when you are
                                                struggling with a problem and then BOOM it works!
                                                So back tracking... What am I most eager to learn about? I could not
                                                put my finger on one thing. What I can say
                                                is that I am excited to learn anything and everything new to
                                                challenge myself and keep the "ah ha!" train
                                                rolling! </p>

                                            <p>I have enjoyed pseudo coding. It certainly helps me organize all of
                                                the jumbled thoughts bouncing around in my head. The freedom of
                                                thinking through your project without being burdened down by making
                                                your code work, really helps me better understand what I really want
                                                to code to do. </p>

                                                and declarations. I feel like I am wasting a lot of time having to
                                                go back to w3 as often as I do. I believe this will get better with

                                            <p>I am eager to learn more about JavaScript. In the past I have really
                                                struggled with implementing JavaScript. I feel that I am more
                                                prepared to tackle Java now that I have more background knowledge.

                                            <p>For me to put into words kind of how these work together, I like to
                                                compare them to the human body. HTML is the skeleton that holds the
                                                framework. CSS is the skin that makes us look human, and JavaScript
                                                is the central nervous system that makes everything move. </p>

                                            <p>My blog incorporates very few things at the moment. It is very basic
                                                but as I learn more and progress it will grow. Right now, I have a
                                                Nav bar with multiple links, many different images and giphs, a
                                                subscribe input box (not currently functional), and a footer that
                                                displays the languages that I have incorporated. My favorite thing
                                                about the website is that the links in the header change colors when
                                                you hover over them. They also stay highlighted when you are on the

                                            <p>I believe my learning style has hindered my progress. A lot of our
                                                material is reading. I am better suited to learn from visual/tactile
                                                methods.</p>

                                            <p>Honestly there wasn’t much that held me back this week. I have really
                                                benefitted from being in person. I feel like the content for this
                                                week was more difficult. But I was able to knock out 90% of the
                                                tasks by Tuesday by keeping head down and plugging away. I really
                                                enjoy the freedom of having two days to work on styling and stretch
                                                goals. This give me time to further my knowledge of the content
                                                without freaking out about our Friday code freeze.</p>

                                            <p>I am starting to get a feel for JSON and data structures. The syntax
                                                and application can be a large concept to wrap your head around. I
                                                feel like I will do just fine with them after more exposure and

                                            <p>I really like the concept of atomic design. It helps me wrap my head
                                                around what is actually grouped together in a webpage. Bootstrap
                                                must be sent from the good lord himself. Its working in a way that I
                                                can understand much better than CSS. I love the ease and clean look.
